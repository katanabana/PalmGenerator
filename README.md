To train the model:
1. extract [`data.zip`](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/yY6QMlgUxAOCLg) into the root directory of the project
2. run all cells in `Palm-GAN.ipynb`

To do:
* Before transforming original images, white stripes on the right and left should be cut off to make the images square.
* Find more data to teach the model on.
* Try to implement the model from [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363473401_Automatic_Generation_of_Synthetic_Palm_Images) and compare its performance to current model. Choose the best one.
